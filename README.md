##  Usage

You can use this project to:

1. **Classify Pet Breeds** – Automatically identify cat and dog breeds from images using a fine-tuned vision model.
2. **Learn Transfer Learning** – Understand and apply transfer learning techniques using pretrained models.
3. **Practice Data Preprocessing** – Experiment with FastAI’s DataBlock API, data transformations, and augmentations.
4. **Evaluate Model Performance** – Analyze model accuracy using interpretation tools like confusion matrices and training metrics.
5. **Deploy via Gradio** – Launch your model as an interactive web app using Gradio for easy public access.
